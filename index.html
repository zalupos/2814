		<h1>Walking: Overcoming the Weather</h1>
		<p>In any type of weather, walking is fun to do on your own, or with family or friends. Don’t let the heat, cold, rain or snow stop you from exploring your community on foot, but before going outside remember to be prepared. Here are a few tips to keep you moving year round.</p>
		
		<h3>Walking when it's cold outside</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid icy surfaces and try to walk where you’ll be shielded from the wind.</li>
			<li>Wear a warm hat, gloves, and comfortable clothing in layers.</li>
			<li>Wear shoes with good treads and rubber or neoprene soles.</li>
			<li>Watch for cars when passing snow banks.</li>
			<li>Choose a route that’s been cleared of ice and snow. Call your local phone to report issues if sidewalks or transit stops are not cleared of ice and snow after a significant snowfall. To learn more about winter maintenance on local sidewalks and trails, visit your local municipality’s website</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Walking when it’s hot outside</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Choose a shaded route.</li>
			<li>Drink lots of water.</li>
			<li>Wear a hat and sunscreen, especially between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. when UV Index is high.</li>
			<li>Wear light clothing that protects you from insects and the sun’s rays.</li>
		</ul>
